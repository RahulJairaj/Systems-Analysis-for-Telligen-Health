# Systems Analysis for Telligen Health

Telligen’s goal is to solve healthcare challenges that are being faced by its diverse clients, by delivering improved health solutions to them. In order to achieve that goal, Telligen must continually find ways to deliver solutions that will improve quality and lower costs by leveraging its deep clinical and technical expertise. One new way to do so, is by developing a system that will track the health records of clients’ employees, generate reports for different stakeholders thereby offering healthcare intelligence. The project has begun with requirements gathering and analysis as per conversation with client. This document includes the Systems analysis and design documents developed in the process of evaluating and determining the Telligen’s needs. It includes the system requirements, a use case analysis, data flow diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. This document also includes major interface prototypes and a proposed implementation plan. In addition, there are detailed analyses on the technical, economic, legal, cultural feasibility including ROI, payback analyses, legacy data management etc.
